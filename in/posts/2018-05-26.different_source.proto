Usually all the images I post are made from my own photographs, in this recent
update to the gallery here I added an image that breaks that trend however, and
was instead taken by a friend of mine on a recent trip.

Initially I was sort of trying to create an actual panorama out of several
images taken in sequence, but it quickly became aparent that the perspective
shift was too great, which of course screws with proper panorama-making.

This image was generated from three photographs taken from airplane during
takeoff, merged together with hugin, and with a bit of work with xxd, sort, and
the gimp.
