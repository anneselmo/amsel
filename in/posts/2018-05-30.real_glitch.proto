About a month ago I was on a short trip to a nearby city, and unfortunately I
had but an single small card for my camera. I tried moving most of the images
over to a laptop during the day, but an underpowered or otherwise wonky USB
plug caused some errors in transport. </p> <p>
Fortunately some of these errors seemed to turn into at least a more or less
interesting effect, causing bars with bands and offset parts of the actual
image. </p> <p> 
This image is produced from overlaying a few borked images of one scene along
with unborked ones, I mixed in an image of some plants with audacity, and
layered it all together in the Gimp.
